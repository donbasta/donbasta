### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Farras, a third-year Informatics student at Institut Teknologi Bandung.

I am currently focusing on Competitive Programming and Web Development.
My interest is AI/ML, Quantum Computing, Theoretical CS. Quite heavy, huh.
Even I don't know about them, yet. Sounds fancy though, and therefore interesting.

* ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently searching for the meaning of my code
